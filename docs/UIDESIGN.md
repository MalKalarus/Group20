## UI Design Page 

[Home](README.md)  

### The Resume! web app is designed to provide simplicity, through a consistent colour scheme and layout, easy navigation, and easy-to-follow instructions. The website has a consistent green shaded menu bar at the top of each webpage, where a user can find contact information, information about the web app, and help. The light grey colour of the background across all webpages is plain yet provides simplicity. ###

### Resume! also makes navigating through different webpages easy, by using distinct, brightly coloured large buttons to lead the user to wherever the want to go next, as they navigate through intuitively ordered webpages. They begin at the home website where they can be directed to either log in or sign up, before choosing a resume template on the resume templates webpage after they sign up. Then they fill out more personal information on a separate page to build their resume profile before it can be evaluated through a visual score graph. Once they have further edited their resume, they can access their profile or be directed to a job search. ###

### The Home page provides users with a list of important features the web app has to offer, as well as a glimpse of the positive      experiences of other users. The search bar near the top of the page allows the user to search for different pages in the app, such as a resume template examples page. The notification icon shaped as a bell notifies users who are logged in of new messages in their inbox. Users who are not logged in can log in through the blue labelled button "Login to Your Account", or sign up with a new account through the green labelled button "Signup to Build Your Resume". ###

### If the user selects the "Signup to Build Your Resume" button on the home page, they will be directed to this sign up options page. Here they can sign up as either a normal user who is looking to build their resume and profile, or an employer who is not only looking to build their resume, but also searching for candidates for their company. ###

### Once the user selects who they want to sign up as, the user can formally sign up by entering their name, email, and password, or signing up through third party websites. ###

### After the user signs up, the first step in the process of building their resume is choosing a resume template. They can narrow down their selection of templates by choosing template designs specific to a certain field, which can be done by selecting the "Search Templates by Field" dropdown button. When hovering over a resume template, an overlay appears over the template with option to choose it. ###

### The next step in the resume buiding process is actually building a profile, based on level of experience in the industry, a user's career field, and additional information. After the user chooses one of the first four options of who they are (Student, Experienced, Entry Level, Executive), a panel opens up below, where they will be prompted to fill in the text fields. Once they click the button "Next", another panel opens up below, with fields which prompt the user to enter more personal information, such as their address and phone number. ###

### When the user clicks the button "Save and Next" on the resume builder page, they will be taken to a page which shows the current resume with the information already filled out based on the information inputted on the previous page. The user can choose to edit their resume, in which they would be able to actually type in an editor, or if they are satisfied with their resume, they can click the button "Get Resume Score Now", to have their resume evaluated by the app. ##
