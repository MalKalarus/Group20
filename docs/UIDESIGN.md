## UI Design Page 

[Home](README.md)  

### The Resume! web app is designed to provide simplicity, through a consistent colour scheme and layout, easy navigation, and easy-to-follow instructions. The website has a consistent green shaded menu bar at the top of each webpage, where a user can find contact information, information about the web app, and help. The light grey colour of the background across all webpages is plain yet provides simplicity. Resume! also makes navigating through different webpages easy, by using distinct, brightly coloured large buttons to lead the user to wherever the want to go next, as they navigate through intuitively ordered sites. They begin at the home website where they can be directed to either log in or sign up, before choosing a resume template on the resume templates webpage after they sign up. Then they fill out more personal information on a separate page to build their resume profile before it can be evaluated through a visual score graph. Once they have further edited their resume, they can access their profile or be directed to a job search. ###
