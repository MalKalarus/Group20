Carolyn is a Java and C developer focused on gaining mastery of those languages and learning more about graphics and sound applications.  As a former Respiratory Therapist and amateur writer, she has a broad education encompassing health-care and the arts as well as computer science.  When she is not offering up her time at the altar of computing, she enjoys knitting, playing with puppies, and reading Harry Potter fanfiction.
